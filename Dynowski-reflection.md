> What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

None, really. I believe I have a good grasp of the git workflow and, more generally, the reasons for using some type of version control - and git, specifically.

> What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Again, everything was pretty clear to me going in. I did ask about and learn the reasons that one might do a fetch-and-merge, rather than just pulling a repo from remote (basically, it's an extra level of safety - pull will just replace whatever you've got, conflicts or no, while a fetch and merge will allow you to see and correct any conflicts that exist).

> What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

Unfortunately, I was the only one to sign up for my particular GPS, so I didn't have a pair. I asked the guide about the aforementioned pull vs. fetch/merge question, and just some general questions to be sure that I was actually clear on the git process, and not just clear in my head.

> What still confuses you about git?

Nothing, I don't think. I'm sure that as soon as I move beyond basic-level stuff, I'll run into some confusion, though.

> How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

See above in re: pairing, but the overall process was very pleasant. My guide was awesome, and very helpful. I am a little disappointed that I didn't have a pair, so I spent basically the whole time driving, though. That's why we have so many opportunities to pair, though, I suppose.
